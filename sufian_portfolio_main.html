            <div class="aboutme">
            <p><em>My music journey began in elementary school, when I first picked up an instrument.</em> I started on the Alto Saxophone. Not too long after, I ended up switching to the clarinet.
            In high school, music enabled me to make friends. I had moved to a new town for high school, so having this activity allowed me to express myself, and meet lots of people.
            Professionally, I have played & taught music. I've played in small jazz groups for gigs around my university, coached high school marching bands, and taught private 1 on 1 lessons.</p>

            <p><em>My journey in software began in college, when I took my first programming course, Introduction to Java.</em> This was my very first exposure to programming, and I felt unsure at the beginning.
            I pushed through, and went on to take Java 2 and eventually Data Structures. These courses helped me tap into the problem-solving part of my brain. After taking Data Structures, I began to work on projects, and go on websites such as LeetCode.
            In Summer of 2023, I interned with CVS Health as a Software Automation Engineer. This position helped me learn more about the CI/CD pipeline, and how a DevOps/Automation team factors into it.
            Most recently, I've started a position at my University as a TA for Data Structures & Algorithms.</P>
